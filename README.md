# HealthTrack: Cognitive Health Monitoring System üß†üè•

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
HealthTrack is a software solution designed to address cognitive health disparities in African communities by providing:
- cognitive assessments
- Lifestyle habit tracking
- Healthcare professional connectivity

### 1.2 Problem Statement
| Aspect       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Who**      | African adults (25-65) with limited access to cognitive healthcare |
| **What**     | Lack of affordable, localized cognitive health monitoring tools |
| **When**     | Persistent need due to rising dementia cases (WHO reports 2.3M cases in Africa, 2023) |
| **Where**    | Urban and peri-urban areas with smartphone penetration |
| **Why**      | Early detection can reduce dementia progression by 40% |
| **How**      | Mobile-first platform with offline capabilities |

## 2. Technical Specifications
### 2.1 System Features
| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Cognitive Tests | Memory/attention assessments | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Lifestyle Dashboard | Sleep/nutrition/exercise tracking | ‚úÖ Implemented |
| Healthcare Network | Verified professional directory | üöß In Progress |

### 2.2 Technology Stack
| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Frontend | React.js | Cross-platform compatibility |
| Backend | Django REST | Rapid development for African context |
| Database | PostgreSQL | ACID compliance for medical data |
| Deployment | Vercel + Render | Cost-effective for African startups |

## 3. Development Approach
### 3.1 Software Development Model
**Agile Methodology**  
*Selected because:*
- Allows iterative improvements based on user feedback
- Accommodates resource constraints common in African tech ecosystems
- Supports parallel development of core modules

*Implementation Steps:*
1. Sprint 1: Core assessment engine (completed)
2. Sprint 2: Data visualization (current)
3. Sprint 3: Professional network integration (planned needs discussion with healthcare professional for implementation)

### 3.2 Hypothesis
"Deploying a health platform will increase early cognitive impairment detection rates among target users."

## 4. Installation Guide
### 4.1 Local Development

# Frontend
cd PRODIM/my-app && npm install && npm start

# Backend 
cd PRODIM/dementia_prevention
python manage.py runserver
